      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
      in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
      personal information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent.&nbsp;</strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent)
          to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
          compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
          exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
          involved.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect
          your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats
          to the safety of any person.

      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your

      consent). You can&nbsp;<a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a>&nbsp;at any time.
      <br />
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
      your consent, including, for example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way

        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>
          If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
          insurance claim

        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
        <li>
          If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
          accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of
          an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
        </li>
        <li>
          If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to

        <li>
          If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the

      <br />
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
      other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
      than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
      <br />
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further

      <br />
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
      the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
      be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
      parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
      from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

      for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a

      your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information
      already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
